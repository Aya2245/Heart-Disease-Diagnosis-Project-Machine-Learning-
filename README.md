# Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-Project-Machine-Learning-
 Developed and optimized machine learning models for accurate heart disease diagnosis from clinical data.
Technologies: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Keras), demonstrating proficiency in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
Key Achievements:
Designed and trained a Neural Network that achieved 97.73% accuracy on the test set, significantly outperforming traditional SVM models (best SVM at 91.23%).
Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization, contributing to the Neural Network's superior performance.
Proficiently utilized various evaluation metrics and visualizations to present clear comparative analysis of model effectiveness.
